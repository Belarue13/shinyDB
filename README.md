# shinyDB
Program to calculate shiny odds in pokemon games based on location and previous encounters. All data must be user generated. I only added pokemon ruby and sapphire Fiery Path.

**REQUIRES JDK 20+ AND WINDOWS**

Note: when prompted to enter a game name, if the txt doesnt exist for it yet, one will be made for you.

[p] - calculate the odds of encountering a pokemon at a location + its shiny rate.
[l] - calculate the odds of encountering every pokemon at a location and their shiny rates.
[e] - calculate the odds of encountering a shiny after already encountering non shiny varients.
[a] - add a pokemon to the database. Requires pokemon name, location, and encounter rate.
[c] - close program


// update note:
will add a search function to find all locations of a pokemon and their encounter rates
works for games up to gen 4 with no shiny charm. Using 1/8192 odds.
